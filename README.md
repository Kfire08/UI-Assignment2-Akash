<br/><br/>

Tech Used: HTML, CSS and Javascript
<br/><br>
Features of the website:
<br/>
1. Two card layout for tablet. Single card layout for desktop and mobile.
2. Search new both using the search bar and with the query string in the page url.
3. Refresh option to see new content every 30 seconds.
4. Infinite scroll feature for news cards.

#### Note: While running the infinite scroll you might observe repeating news because news items are running on loop as there is limited content in the API which I am using here for testing purpose. The APIs which provide more content have limited hits and that might make the website unusable if the number of hits are reached.
